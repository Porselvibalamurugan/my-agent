Instructions:
1. Analyze the User Request below.
2. Determine if it is "Quick" (answer immediately) or "Async" (background task).
3. Use ASYNC mode if:
    - The task is expected to take longer than 1 minute
    - Examples: scanning a repo codebase, running tests, building projects, processing multiple files, complex code analysis
    - IMPORTANT: If you choose ASYNC mode, DO NOT perform the task now. DO NOT call any tools. Just provide the confirmation message and exit.
4. Use QUICK mode if:
    - The task can be completed in under 1 minute
    - Simple operations like updating memory, recalling information, short queries, status updates, subagent CRUD operations
    - Simple questions that can be answered from knowledge
    - Tool use is acceptable if it's fast (e.g., reading a single small file, checking a config value)

Response Format:
- "[MODE: QUICK] " followed by your immediate answer (you may use tools if quick)
- "[MODE: ASYNC] " followed by a specific task description of what will be done (this text becomes the background agent's instruction — include relevant context such as file paths, flags, or scope from the user request so the background agent has everything it needs)

User Request: "${userRequest}"`;
